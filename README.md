# pssp_enhancements
Assignment 9, HHA 504, AHI, SBU



Create a new GitHub repo called `pssp_enhancements` - I recommend that you take the last module from 504 Part7_Login_CRUD_enhanced subfolder

GOALS: 
1. Update the landing page to look more like a fake patient portal

2. Create another new account type called: care provider

    The care provider should have permissions to edit existing patients
    There should be a new endpoint for creating this account type; and a new dropdown field value within SQL for account_type

3. Enable edit functionality for profile

    Should be able to update email, username



TO DELIVER: 
- GitHub repo 
- Video (e.g., Zoom recorded to the cloud, provide me with link + password) that provides me with a demo of what you were able to accomplish, and what troubles you encounter
